polblogs_nodepairs.txt generated with:
./genRandomNodeNums.py 1000 1490 > polblogs_nodepairs.txt

Then the test can be run on this input with:
./run_test_polblogs.sh

This way the same polblogs_nodepairs.txt can
be used with the same polblogs network
to test two-path matrix update and change
statistics with different implementations
as they should get the same results repeatably.

polblogs_test_results_baseline.txt is the output from
PNet code to compare output with as a regression test,
which is what run_test_polblogs.sh does.
