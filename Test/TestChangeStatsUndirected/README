netscience_nodepairs.txt generated with:

 python2 ../TestChangeStatsDirected/genRandomNodeNums.py 1000 1589 > netscience_nodepairs.txt
 
netscience_test_results.out generated with:

 time ./testChangeStats netscience_edgelist.txt  netscience_nodepairs.txt  > netscience_test_results.out

This way the same netscience_nodepairs.txt can
be used wiht the same netscience network
to test two-path matrix update and change
statistics with different implementations
as they should get the same results repaetably

netscience_test_results_baseline.txt is the output from
PNet code to compare output with as a regression test,
which is what run_test_netscience.sh does.
